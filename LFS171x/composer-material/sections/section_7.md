## Knowledge Check X.1
<!-- A + C -->
Hyperledger Composer can be best described as:

<ol type="A">
  <li>A collaboration tool for business owners and developers to create smart contracts</li>
  <li>A high level solution to build distributed applications on public blockchain networks</li>

  <li>All of the above</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.2
<!-- B -->
What can be included in a Business Network?

<ol type="A">
  <li>Identities Card, Connection Profiles, Blockchain Ledger, World State Database</li>
  <li>Participant, Assets, Transaction Logic, Events</li>
  <li>All of the above</li>
  <li>None of the above</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.3
<!-- D -->
Which are the benefits of using Hyperledger Ccomposer?

<ol type="A">
  <li>Facilitate revisions and rearrangements when prototyping PoCs or MVPs</li>
  <li>Set up privacy settings and confidentiality for the business operations</li>
  <li>Integrate the blockchain network to existing systems</li>
  <li>All of the above</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.4
<!-- B -->
When running Hyperledger Composer, a backend such as Hyperledger Fabric network is necessary to:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Test the business network online using Composer Playground</li>
  <li>Persist data and provide the world state database</li>
  <li>Define the models of Participants, Assets and Transactions</li>
  <li>Restrict the permissions of Participants to access specific resources</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.5
<!-- A -->
Hyperledger Composer has been designed with a view to support other frameworks such as Sawtooth and Iroha in the future.

<ol type="A">
  <li>True</li>
  <li>False</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.6
<!-- D -->
Hyperledger Composer can retrieve data stored on blockchain using:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Access Control Language</li>
  <li>Modeling Language</li>
  <li>Business Network Archive (.bna file)</li>
  <li>Rich Queries</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.7
<!-- B -->
The Modeling language is necessary to:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Define the Transaction Logic</li>
  <li>Validate fields using regular expressions</li>
  <li>Perform rich queries into the network</li>
  <li>Specify the consensus algorithm in Hyperledger Composer</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.8
<!-- C -->
The transaction logic files:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Define the models for Participants, Assets, Transactions, Concepts and Events</li>
  <li>Contain access control rules to restrict the permissions of different participants</li>
  <li>Implement what the transaction function will perform when executed</li>
  <li>None of the above</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.9
<!-- A + C -->
The Composer Playground can be used to:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Define the models for Participants, Assets, Transactions, Concepts and Events</li>
  <li>Perform queries to retrieve data stored in the blockchain</li>
  <li>Write the transaction logic for the transactions specified in the .cto file</li>
  <li>All of the above</li>
</ol>

## Knowledge Check X.10
<!-- B -->
The Composer REST server can be used to:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Define the models for Participants, Assets, Transactions, Concepts and Events</li>
  <li>Perform queries to retrieve data stored in the blockchain</li>
  <li>Write the transaction logic for the transactions specified in the .cto file</li>
  <li>All of the above</li>
</ol>
