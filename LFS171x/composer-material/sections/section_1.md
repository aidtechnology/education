# Intro and Overview

## Introduction to Hyperledger Composer [VIDEO]

Hello everyone, we are Nicola and Sasha, the content creators for the Hyperledger Composer chapter.

In this chapter we will guide you  through a demo scenario to highlight the key components of Hyperledger Composer.

***

Hyperledger Composer is a toolset and framework that has been designed to make it easier to prototype and integrate blockchain applications with existing business systems. 

***

In Hyperledger Composer you can develop and deploy a full-fledged Blockchain network using most of the functionality available to frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric. 

Hyperledger Composer provides domain-specific languages for Modelling, Query and Access Control that simplify the development. 
Also, visual components like Playground are helpful to communicate and visualise the structure and to test the interactions over the network.

***

Then starting from the actual business requirements, technical and business individuals can work together to build blockchain applications using Hyperledger Composer.

***

Today it works with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. However it has been designed with a view to supporting other frameworks down the road, such as Sawtooth, Iroha, etc.

***

As you work through this section, you may want to find out more about Hyperledger Composer. 
There are resources you can check out, like GitHub, RocketChat and others. 
You will find the links at the end of this chapter.

Letâ€™s get into it!
