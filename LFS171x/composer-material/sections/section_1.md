## Introduction to Hyperledger Composer

[#VIDEO]

> Hello everyone, I am Nicola and I am Sasha,
> 
> we are the content creators for the Hyperledger Composer chapter.
> 
> In this chapter we will guide you through a demo scenario to highlight the key components of Hyperledger Composer.
> 
> Hyperledger Composer is a toolset and framework that has been designed to make it easier to prototype and integrate blockchain applications with existing business systems.
> 
> In Hyperledger Composer you can develop and deploy a full-fledged Blockchain network.
> 
> And use most of the functionality available to frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric.
> 
> Hyperledger Composer provides domain-specific languages for Modelling, Query and Access Control that simplify the development.
> 
> Also, visual components like Playground are helpful to communicate and visualise the structure and to test the interactions over the network.
> 
> Then starting from the actual business requirements, technical and business individuals can work together to build blockchain applications using Hyperledger Composer.
> 
> Today it works with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. However it has been designed with a view to supporting other frameworks down the road, such as Sawtooth, Iroha, etc.
> 
> As you work through this section, you may want to find out more about Hyperledger Composer.
> 
> There are resources you can check out, like GitHub, RocketChat and others.
> 
> You will find the links at the end of this chapter.
> 
> Letâ€™s get into it!
